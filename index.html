          <h2>Introduction to Non-Mechanical Keyboards</h2>
        </div>

        <div>All physical keyboards share a common design functionality - the user presses a button down which interacts with the underlying curcuitboard which sends instructions to the connected device to ouput an intended fucntion specific to that button or 'key' (usually to input a character)</div>
        <div>Common keyboards usually come under three different categories:</div>
        <div class="common-boards">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <div class="headings">Membrane</div>
              <div>A membrane keyboard is a computer keyboard whose "keys" are not separate, moving parts, as with the majority of other keyboards, but rather are pressure pads that have only outlines and symbols printed on a flat, flexible surface. Very little, if any, tactile feedback is felt when using such a keyboard. The lack of feedback is usually subsidised with an audial or visual cue. Usually found on things like micro-waves and simple touchpads</div>
            </div>  
            <div class="column">
              <img src="/img/membrane.png">
            </div>  
          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <div class="headings">Dome-Switch</div>
              <div>Dome-switch keyboards are a hybrid of flat-panel membrane and switch keyboards. They bring two circuit board traces together under a rubber or silicone keypad using either metal "dome" switches or polyurethane formed domes. The metal dome switches are formed pieces of stainless steel that, when compressed, give the user crisp, positive tactile feedback. These metal types of dome switches are very common, and are used in the large majority of offices world-wide</div>
            </div>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <div class="headings">Scissor-Switch</div>
              <div>The keys are attached to the keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a "scissor"-like fashion and snap to the keyboard and the key. It still uses rubber domes, but a special plastic 'scissors' mechanism links the keycap to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard. Usually present on most laptops.</div>

          <h2>Mechanical Keyboards - The Mechanical Switch</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="container mechs">
          <img src="/img/mechswitch.png">

          <div>
            <div>So what makes a mechanical keyboard... well, <i class="keycolor">mechanical</i>? Its the specifically mechanical design and functinallty of the underlying switches beneath each key. The switches are engineered to provide the user with fluid and responsive tactility along with consistent audio cues allowing for a more effecient typing experience.</div>
              <ul class = "mechswitch">
                <div><b class ="keycolor">Bottom/Top Housing - </b>Plastic containers used to house the switch components and <b><i>secure the switch</i></b> in place</div>
                <div><b class="keycolor">Metal Leaf - </b>The base prongs extrude from the bottom housing and <b><i>connect the switch</i></b> to the electrical circuitry. Slots into the stem to provide it stabibilty</div>
                <div><b class="keycolor">Spring - </b>The top housing, once secured into the bottom housing, compresses the spring which in turn <b><i>provide actuation force</i></b> to the switch components</div>
                <div><b class="keycolor">Stem - </b>At rest, the spring forces the stem to the top of the switch housing and leaving the underlying circuit open, when pushed down it forces the metal leaf down which <b><i>closes the circuit</i></b> 'activiating' the key</div>
              </ul>
        </div>
        
      </div>
      <div>There are a multitude of different types with various features but they essnetially boil down to 3 categories (or a hybrid of the three):</div>
      <div class="container mechtypes">

        <div class="column">
          <div class="headings">Linear</div>
          <img src="/img/gif_linear.webp">
          <div class="descr">Linear switches are a type of switch that focus on producing a smooth, consistent actuation without any tactile feedback.
            Great for people who don’t like the small bump experienced from tactile switches or the loud noises from clicky switches.
            Usually quiet, smooth, and consistent throughout the entire movement.
            Especially used by gamers as the consistent keystrokes allow for more precision in highly competitive games.
            Also enjoyed by people who prefer smooth movements while typing.</div> 
        </div>

        <div class="column">
          <div class="headings">Tactile</div>
          <img src="/img/gif_tactile.webp">
          <div class="descr">Tactile switches are a type of switch that focus on producing a tactile bump and a relatively quiet audible click with each keystroke.
            Tactile switches offer great feedback when typing, so you know by the sound and feel everything is working properly and all of your keystrokes are getting logged. Not to mention they are satisfying and fun to use.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="column">
          <div class="headings">Clicky</div>
          <img src="/img/gif_clicky.webp">
          <div class="descr">Clicky switches are a type of switch that focus on producing a tactile bump and loud audible click with each keystroke.
            Loud and clicky switches offer great feedback when typing, so you know by the sound everything is working properly. Not to mention the sound is awesome.</div> 
        </div>

      <div>Which of the three is 'best' is debateable and mainly comes down to user preference. The great thing about mechanical keybaords is that theese days most boards allow their switches to be interchangeable rather than hard-soldered onto the motherboard like the large majority of other keyboards. This interchangeability is known as <b class="keycolor">'Hot-Swappable'</b> and is a very desireable trait. Watch this short video demonstrating the differnece between various types of switches.</div>
